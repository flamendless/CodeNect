\textbf{Objectives of the Study}\\
\justifying
\parx
The general objective of the study is to develop a CodeNext: Visual Programming
Software that will help in learning the fundamentals of programming.

\parx
Specifically, this study seeks:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify the concepts learners find difficult to understand through conducted survey.
	\item Analyze the problems through a Ishikawa/Fishbone Diagram.
	\item Design the system using the Use Case Diagrams.
	\item Develop the software with the following main features:

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Visual Nodes Module handles the core elements and building blocks
				in the software for writing logic and code.
			\item Filesystem Module handles the creation, modification, reading, and
				deletion of files.
			\item Input and Output Module is the interface for user actions such as mouse
				events and key events and what is displayed to the screen for the user.
			\item Debug Module lints the visual code for errors and warnings before
				the running the code. It also captures errors and warnings during runtime
				and report it to the user.
			\item Simulation Module for compiling and running the visual program to
				a command line program.
			\item Transpiler Module that will convert the visual logic to other
				programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Lua, and
				more.
			\item Assessment Module that will evaluate the knowledge and learning of the
				users by providing basic and common coding exercises. Exercises can be
				imported, shared, and distributed through simple package files.
		\end{enumerate}

	\item Test the usability, functionality of the software using Experience-based test design.

	\item Evaluate the acceptability of the software using the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4.2015. \\
\end{enumerate}
