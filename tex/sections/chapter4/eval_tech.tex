\textbf{Technical Evaluation Results}
\justifying
\parx
The researchers gathered ten professionals in the field of Information
Technology and Computer Science for the technical evaluation of the system on
May 24 and 25 year 2021. The technical evaluators assessed the software
according to the ISO 9126 metrics (See Appendix B) and provided feedback
through the use of Google Form Sheet.

\parx
The rating used for the evaluation: 4.21 - 5.00 as Excellent which indicates that the
software fully meets and far exceeds the most expectations and requirements.
3.41 - 4.20 as Very Good which indicates that the software fully meets and exceeds
several expectations and requirements. 2.61 - 3.40 as Good which indicates that the
system fully meets the requirements. 1.81 - 2.60 as Fair which indicates that the software
lacks in meeting the expectations and requirements. 1.00 - 1.80 as Poor, which
indicates that the software fails to meet the expectations and requirements.

% FUNCTIONALITY
\parx
The calculation of the evaluation results, Table \ref{table:tech_functionality} shows the
functionality of the software was rated "???" (mean = ???, SD = ???) with criteria
such as informative (mean = ???, SD = ???), accurate (mean = ???, SD = ???),
and interoperability (mean = ???, SD = ???).
