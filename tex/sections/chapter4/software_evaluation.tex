\textbf{Software Evaluation}
\justifying

\parx
The functionalities of the software has been evaluated accordingly. The
features and effectiveness of the software will be verified by ten college
students taking programming subjects as the non-technical evaluators and another ten
IT professionals as technical evaluators. Feedbacks and remarks are collected from the
evaluators for further analysis by the researchers. The evaluators used a numerical
rating with the interpretation shown in Table \ref{table:ratings_scale}.
