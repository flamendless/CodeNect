\parx
C++, a programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as a superset of the
C programming language, is a compiled, statically-type, performant, and
feature-rich language used and is the first choice almost anywhere from
embedded machine to large system (\cite{cpp_2020}).

The C++ programming language provides powerful and flexible capabilities for
abstraction. It is designed to be high-level and efficient as close to
machine language as possible (\cite{stroustrup_1999}).

C++ is the choice used and in combination with in Unreal Engine's Blueprints
Visual Scripting System as provides safety due to its type system, security,
flexibility, modularity, and efficiency (\cite{chu_zaman_2021}).
