Context diagram is a simple diagram that shows the source systems contributing data to
a system as well as the major user constituents and downstream information systems
that it supports. This diagram is so simple that it makes it perfect for agile
requirement management. This diagram also called “Level 0” data flows diagrams because
if one were to put arrows on the connections between sources and targets, the diagram
could serve as the cover sheet of a data flow diagram packet that many analysts prepare
for traditionally managed projects. This diagram greatly reduce project risk because
they are easy for a team’s business partners to understand (\cite{hughes_2016}).
