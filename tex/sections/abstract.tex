	The CodeNect: Visual Programming Software For Learning Fundamentals of
	Programming was developed for aiding beginners in the field of programming
	get a better grasp and understanding about its fundamentals.

	\parx
	The software is composed of seven modules which are the Input/Output, Visual
	Nodes, Transpiler, Filesystem, Simulation, Debug, and Assessment modules.

	\parx
	The V-Model was used as methodology for the development of the software which
	has the following phases: requirements, system design, architecture design, module
	design, implementation and coding, and testing.

	\parx
	The visual programming software was evaluated using the ISO 9126 standards with the
	criteria for quality including functionality, reliability, usability, maintanability,
	efficiency, and portability. The software passed the criteria for evaluation and met
	all the requirements and objectives having an overall mean of 4.50.
